# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the projects foir this course, I solved problems pertaining to the speed and efficiency of algorithms. These algorithms involved the functionality of different in-memory data structures, including vectors, hash tables, and binary trees.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached these problems with emphasis on analysing the different aspects of each data structure, including it's search speed, addition and deletion speed, and the amount of code it takes to program its functionality.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
When I encountered roadblocks, I looked back on the notes and resources that my school provided, asked for help from tutors, and looked up syntax issues I encountered on Google. Ultimately, I just studied more with the goal of undertsanding as much of the content as possible.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This course has made me consider aspects such as efficiency and speed in my programs - something I hadn't paid much mind to in the past.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
After this course, I now put a lot more emphasis on modularizing my programs, i.e. putting code in classes and creating functions and structs that work together to form a cohesive program with a structure that provides for easy maintenence.
